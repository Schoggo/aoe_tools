# aoe_tools

This [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) mod adds tools that can dig nodes in an area, just like, eg, the Hammer and Excavator from [Tinkers' Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct).

This is currently broken, it needs an engine feature I'm just implementing.

Currently this mod is very much WIP.
