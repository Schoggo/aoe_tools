# aoe_tools

This [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/) mod adds tools that can dig nodes in an area, just like, eg, the Hammer and Excavator from [Tinkers' Construct](https://github.com/SlimeKnights/TinkersConstruct).

To use the AOE-digging function, you have to rightclick the node in the middle and then mine it.

Currently this mod is very much WIP.
